## Current Implementation State

| field | value |
|---|---|
| project | L1-identity |
| design_repo | `/home/aris/Projects/quantalithos-design` |
| implementation_repo | `/home/aris/Projects/quantalithos-identity` |
| current_design_baseline | `d9f9e71` |
| current_boundary | `commit-04-b` |
| gate_status | pending |
| gate_reason | implementation ledger and `commit-04-b` boundary ledger created after design blocker; implementation agent must read and advance boundary gates before code changes |
| next_allowed_action | read_docs |
| current_recovery_point | `commit-04-b` open boundary / PH-04 role-career-memory command write chain |
| last_updated_by | design agent |
| last_updated_at | 2026-06-15 |

## Boundary Ledger

| boundary | design_baseline | status | last_gate | next_allowed_action | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `commit-04-b` | `d9f9e71` | pending | design_gate | read_docs | Role/career/memory command boundary; read `implementation-boundaries/commit-04-b.md` before implementation. |

---

## Open Blockers

| blocker_id | boundary | source | status | design_fix_baseline | next_action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| BLK-ID-04B-LEDGER-001 | `commit-04-b` | implementation | resolved | `d9f9e71` | Implementation ledger and boundary ledger now exist; implementation agent must continue from `read_docs`. |

---

## Recovery Protocol

Any implementation agent resuming `L1-identity` must read files in this order:

1. `projects/L1-identity/design-calibration/implementation_execution_ledger.md`
2. `projects/L1-identity/design-calibration/implementation-boundaries/commit-04-b.md`
3. `projects/L1-identity/07-实施计划.md`
4. The `required_reads` listed by the current boundary ledger.
5. Optional implementation scratch ledger: `/home/aris/Projects/quantalithos-identity/.codex/implementation_ledger.md`

If any required design source is missing or contradicts the current boundary, set `gate_status = blocked`, set `next_allowed_action = wait_design`, and stop implementation.

## Current Implementation State

| field | value |
|---|---|
| project | L3-method-library |
| design_repo | `/home/aris/Projects/quantalithos-design` |
| implementation_repo | `/home/aris/Projects/quantalithos-method-library` |
| current_design_baseline | `149c2dc277b8dd36efd885e152fcb421a99a0fd4` |
| current_boundary | `commit-01-b` |
| gate_status | ready_for_design_gate |
| gate_reason | Formal `04-配置设计.md` §9 and `07-实施计划.md` §3 / §6 / §8 now close `OQ-ML-003` for `commit-01-b`: config skeleton file format is strict JSON, directory is `config/profiles/`, required files are the four P0 profiles, and current boundary CLI names are fixed. |
| next_allowed_action | read_docs |
| current_recovery_point | `commit-01-b` may resume from required reads and rerun its boundary Design Gate before implementation edits |
| last_updated_by | design agent |
| last_updated_at | 2026-06-29 09:10:43 +0800 |

## Boundary Ledger

| boundary | design_baseline | status | last_gate | next_allowed_action | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `commit-01-a` | `3965cdc74da0fc3c0d38d7746108d42b4a58f6ca` | implemented | handoff_gate | start_next_boundary | Implementation repo reports `commit-01-a` completed at `1a7137f9adcefc76796c6e896a0ec4d15c2b4241`; seven-crate workspace layout and core dependency boundary handoff are closed. |
| `commit-01-b` | `149c2dc277b8dd36efd885e152fcb421a99a0fd4` | pending | design_gate | read_docs | Formal `04/07` now close config skeleton file format, directory and CLI parameter names for `commit-01-b`; implementation must restart from required reads, rerun the boundary Design Gate, and only then proceed within scope. |

## Open Blockers

| blocker_id | boundary | source | status | design_fix_baseline | next_action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| BLK-ML-01A-LEDGER-001 | `commit-01-a` | design handoff | resolved | `3965cdc74da0fc3c0d38d7746108d42b4a58f6ca` | Project implementation ledger and current boundary ledger now exist; implementation agent must continue from `read_docs`. |
| BLK-ML-01B-ACTIVATION-001 | `commit-01-b` | implementation | resolved | `3965cdc74da0fc3c0d38d7746108d42b4a58f6ca` | `commit-01-a` handoff is now closed and the project ledger advances to `commit-01-b`; current next action is governed by `BLK-ML-01B-DESIGN-001`. |
| BLK-ML-01B-DESIGN-001 | `commit-01-b` | implementation | resolved | `149c2dc277b8dd36efd885e152fcb421a99a0fd4` | Formal `04-配置设计.md` §9 and `07-实施计划.md` §3 / §6 / §8 now fix `commit-01-b` config skeleton file format, directory, required files and CLI parameter names; implementation may resume from `read_docs`. |

---

## Recovery Protocol

Any implementation agent resuming `L3-method-library` must read files in this order:

1. `projects/L3-method-library/design-calibration/implementation_execution_ledger.md`
2. `projects/L3-method-library/design-calibration/implementation-boundaries/commit-01-b.md`
3. `projects/L3-method-library/07-实施计划.md`
4. The `required_reads` listed by the current boundary ledger.
5. Optional implementation scratch ledger: `/home/aris/Projects/quantalithos-method-library/.codex/implementation_ledger.md`

If any required design source is missing, contradicts the current boundary, or does not close a schema / port / state / marker / config / evidence field needed for implementation, set `gate_status = blocked`, set `next_allowed_action = wait_design`, and stop implementation.

## Implementation Repo Baseline Notes

| item | status | implementation rule |
|---|---|---|
| target repository | exists | `/home/aris/Projects/quantalithos-method-library` is the only implementation repo for this project. |
| git identity | checked | Expected local config is `quantalithos-labs <quantalithos.ai@gmail.com>`. |
| current layout | old material | Existing `crates/method_library_*` style layout is old implementation material and must not be treated as design truth. |
| first allowed boundary | `commit-01-a` | Migrate to formal seven-crate workspace layout before any business DTO/domain/service work. |

---

## Retrospective Boundary Note

| range | status | decision |
|---|---|---|
| pre-implementation | design complete | `00`~`07` have been full-restart assembled and committed before implementation handoff. |
| `commit-01-a` | implemented handoff closed | Implementation handoff records workspace layout migration commit `1a7137f9adcefc76796c6e896a0ec4d15c2b4241`; this boundary is no longer current. |
| `commit-01-b` | current boundary ready for read_docs | This boundary became current after the `commit-01-a` implementation handoff. Formal `04/07` have now closed `OQ-ML-003`, so implementation must resume from required reads and rerun the boundary Design Gate before editing the implementation repo. |

## Current Implementation State

| field | value |
|---|---|
| project | L3-method-library |
| design_repo | `/home/aris/Projects/quantalithos-design` |
| implementation_repo | `/home/aris/Projects/quantalithos-method-library` |
| current_design_baseline | `aaf47faac292315900f153ebb30d5086e0a4c997` |
| current_boundary | `commit-02-b` |
| gate_status | blocked |
| gate_reason | `commit-02-b` required reads expose a design-closure gap: formal `03` / Step 6 / Step 10 / Step 12 / Step 16 name domain truth objects, guard/policy objects, state matrices and domain-error families, but they do not uniquely narrow which subset forms the current boundary's shared `domain base error/state/policy/test support` foundation without crossing into `commit-03-a`+ business domain truth. |
| next_allowed_action | wait_design |
| current_recovery_point | `commit-02-b` Design Gate blocked; design must close the exact shared domain foundation set, error family and test-support scope before any `crates/domain` edits |
| last_updated_by | implementation agent |
| last_updated_at | 2026-06-29 14:11:55 +0800 |

## Boundary Ledger

| boundary | design_baseline | status | last_gate | next_allowed_action | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `commit-01-a` | `3965cdc74da0fc3c0d38d7746108d42b4a58f6ca` | implemented | handoff_gate | start_next_boundary | Implementation repo reports `commit-01-a` completed at `1a7137f9adcefc76796c6e896a0ec4d15c2b4241`; seven-crate workspace layout and core dependency boundary handoff are closed. |
| `commit-01-b` | `eab95f616eb191c06d3065cf6bb1d93149698253` | implemented | handoff_gate | start_next_boundary | Implementation repo reports `commit-01-b` completed at `181604262bded9cc402f918383117ddf56222e54`; config/profile skeletons, dry-run shells and artifact/report root baseline handoff are closed. |
| `commit-02-a` | `aaf47faac292315900f153ebb30d5086e0a4c997` | implemented | handoff_gate | start_next_boundary | Implementation repo reports `commit-02-a` completed at `25876559520691bda2dfd45a0af53bcd38c2f1a9`; public contract foundation, shared shell fixtures and roundtrip tests handoff are closed. |
| `commit-02-b` | `aaf47faac292315900f153ebb30d5086e0a4c997` | blocked | design_gate | wait_design | Required reads show `commit-02-b` lacks a uniquely closed shared domain foundation set; current formal sources mix current-boundary base support with `commit-03-a`+ business truth owners, so implementation must stop and return the closure to design. |

## Open Blockers

| blocker_id | boundary | source | status | design_fix_baseline | next_action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| BLK-ML-01A-LEDGER-001 | `commit-01-a` | design handoff | resolved | `3965cdc74da0fc3c0d38d7746108d42b4a58f6ca` | Project implementation ledger and current boundary ledger now exist; implementation agent must continue from `read_docs`. |
| BLK-ML-01B-ACTIVATION-001 | `commit-01-b` | implementation | resolved | `3965cdc74da0fc3c0d38d7746108d42b4a58f6ca` | `commit-01-a` handoff is now closed and the project ledger advances to `commit-01-b`; current next action is governed by `BLK-ML-01B-DESIGN-001`. |
| BLK-ML-01B-DESIGN-001 | `commit-01-b` | implementation | resolved | `eab95f616eb191c06d3065cf6bb1d93149698253` | Formal `04-配置设计.md` §9 and `07-实施计划.md` §3 / §6 / §8 now fix `commit-01-b` config skeleton file format, directory, required files and CLI parameter names; implementation may resume from `read_docs`. |
| BLK-ML-02A-ACTIVATION-001 | `commit-02-a` | implementation | resolved | `eab95f616eb191c06d3065cf6bb1d93149698253` | `commit-01-b` handoff is now closed and the project ledger advances to `commit-02-a`; implementation agent must continue from `read_docs` and rerun the current boundary Design Gate before editing code. |
| BLK-ML-02A-DESIGN-001 | `commit-02-a` | implementation | resolved | `aaf47faac292315900f153ebb30d5086e0a4c997` | Formal `03-详细设计.md` §7 plus Step 6 / Step 8 now normalize metadata/context placeholder ownership to `core-contracts` and close the concrete shared shell set for `commit-02-a`; required reads were rechecked and implementation may proceed within the current boundary allowed scope. |
| BLK-ML-02B-ACTIVATION-001 | `commit-02-b` | implementation | resolved | `aaf47faac292315900f153ebb30d5086e0a4c997` | `commit-02-a` handoff is now closed and the project ledger advances to `commit-02-b`; implementation agent must continue from `read_docs` and rerun the current boundary Design Gate before editing code. |
| BLK-ML-02B-DESIGN-001 | `commit-02-b` | implementation | blocked | `aaf47faac292315900f153ebb30d5086e0a4c997` | Formal `03` / Step 6 / Step 10 / Step 12 / Step 16 do not uniquely close which domain objects, state helpers, guard/policy judgement boundaries, shared domain error variants and test-support helpers belong to `commit-02-b` as base foundation, versus later `commit-03-a`+ business truth boundaries. |

## Recovery Protocol

Any implementation agent resuming `L3-method-library` must read files in this order:

1. `projects/L3-method-library/design-calibration/implementation_execution_ledger.md`
2. `projects/L3-method-library/design-calibration/implementation-boundaries/commit-02-b.md`
3. `projects/L3-method-library/07-实施计划.md`
4. The `required_reads` listed by the current boundary ledger.
5. Optional implementation scratch ledger: `/home/aris/Projects/quantalithos-method-library/.codex/implementation_ledger.md`

If any required design source is missing, contradicts the current boundary, or does not close a schema / port / state / marker / config / evidence field needed for implementation, set `gate_status = blocked`, set `next_allowed_action = wait_design`, and stop implementation. `commit-02-b` is currently blocked in the Design Gate at baseline `aaf47faac292315900f153ebb30d5086e0a4c997`; no `crates/domain` edit is authorized until the shared domain foundation set is formally narrowed.

## Implementation Repo Baseline Notes

| item | status | implementation rule |
|---|---|---|
| target repository | exists | `/home/aris/Projects/quantalithos-method-library` is the only implementation repo for this project. |
| git identity | checked | Expected local config is `quantalithos-labs <quantalithos.ai@gmail.com>`. |
| current layout | old material | Existing `crates/method_library_*` style layout is old implementation material and must not be treated as design truth. |
| first allowed boundary | `commit-01-a` | Migrate to formal seven-crate workspace layout before any business DTO/domain/service work. |

## Retrospective Boundary Note

| range | status | decision |
|---|---|---|
| pre-implementation | design complete | `00`~`07` have been full-restart assembled and committed before implementation handoff. |
| `commit-01-a` | implemented handoff closed | Implementation handoff records workspace layout migration commit `1a7137f9adcefc76796c6e896a0ec4d15c2b4241`; this boundary is no longer current. |
| `commit-01-b` | implemented handoff closed | Implementation handoff records config/profile, dry-run shell and artifact/report root baseline commit `181604262bded9cc402f918383117ddf56222e54`; this boundary is no longer current. |
| `commit-02-a` | implemented handoff closed | Implementation handoff records public contract foundation commit `25876559520691bda2dfd45a0af53bcd38c2f1a9`; typed refs, metadata/error re-exports, shared shells and roundtrip fixtures are closed. |
| `commit-02-b` | design gate blocked | `commit-02-a` handoff is now closed, but current formal sources do not uniquely close the current boundary's shared domain foundation set; implementation must wait for design-side narrowing before editing `crates/domain`. |
